# Design Philosophy: Bright, Airy, and Optimistic

CentaurOS is a platform for collaboration between humans and AI agents. The design should reflect **optimism, clarity, and openness** - not dark, dreary, or heavy interfaces.

## Core Principles

### 1. Light-First Design
- **Default to light backgrounds** (foundry-50, foundry-100, white)
- Use dark text on light backgrounds for primary content
- Dark mode should be an **opt-in alternative**, not the default aesthetic
- Avoid heavy grays (foundry-800, foundry-900) as primary backgrounds

### 2. Bright Color Palette
- **International Orange** (#ff4500): Primary brand color, use for CTAs and highlights
- **Electric Blue** (#3b82f6): Secondary brand color, use for information and accents
- **Light tones** (foundry-50 through foundry-200): Use for backgrounds and surfaces
- **Vibrant status colors**: Use the bright variants (.light) for backgrounds, not dark variants

### 3. Airy Spacing
- Use generous whitespace - don't cram content
- Prefer `space-y-6` or `space-y-8` over `space-y-2` or `space-y-4`
- Card components should have ample padding (`p-6` or `p-8`)
- Maintain visual breathing room between sections

### 4. Optimistic Messaging
- Use positive, empowering language in UI copy
- Show progress and success states prominently
- Error states should be helpful, not punishing
- Empty states should be encouraging, offering clear next steps

## What to Avoid

❌ **DON'T:**
- Use dark backgrounds (foundry-800, foundry-900) as default
- Create heavy, dense layouts with minimal spacing
- Use muted, desaturated colors as primary UI elements
- Design dark, industrial, or dystopian aesthetics
- Default to "professional gray" color schemes

✅ **DO:**
- Start with light backgrounds (foundry-50, white)
- Use vibrant brand colors (international-orange, electric-blue)
- Create spacious, easy-to-scan layouts
- Embrace brightness and color
- Design for optimism and human-AI collaboration

## Example Patterns

### Card Component (Good)
```tsx
<Card className="bg-white border-foundry-200 p-8 space-y-6">
  <h2 className="text-2xl font-display text-foundry-900">
    Welcome to CentaurOS
  </h2>
  <p className="text-foundry-600 text-lg leading-relaxed">
    Collaborate with AI agents to accomplish amazing things.
  </p>
</Card>
```

### Card Component (Bad - Too Dark)
```tsx
{/* ❌ Don't do this */}
<Card className="bg-foundry-800 border-foundry-700 p-4 space-y-2">
  <h2 className="text-lg text-foundry-100">...</h2>
</Card>
```

### Status Badge (Good - Bright)
```tsx
<Badge className="bg-status-success-light text-status-success-dark">
  Active
</Badge>
```

### Button Hierarchy (Good)
```tsx
{/* Primary: Vibrant brand color */}
<Button className="bg-international-orange hover:bg-international-orange-hover">
  Get Started
</Button>

{/* Secondary: Light with brand accent */}
<Button variant="outline" className="border-electric-blue text-electric-blue">
  Learn More
</Button>
```

## Quick Reference

When in doubt, ask yourself:
- **Is this bright and welcoming?**
- **Does this feel optimistic?**
- **Is there enough whitespace?**
- **Would this inspire collaboration?**

If the answer to any is "no," lighten it up! 🌟
