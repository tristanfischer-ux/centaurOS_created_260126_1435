# Objective Creator

Transform any information into a structured CentaurOS objective with actionable tasks, and add it directly to Tristan Fischer's account at Centaur Dynamics (Tristan.fischer@centaurdynamics.io).

## When to Use

- User shares an idea, goal, or project they want to accomplish
- User asks to "add this as an objective" or "turn this into tasks"
- User provides business requirements, initiatives, or plans
- User mentions creating goals, OKRs, or project milestones

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Understand the Input

1. Identify the core **objective** (the overarching goal)
2. Break down into **discrete, actionable tasks** (3-8 tasks typically)
3. Identify **dependencies** between tasks (which must complete before others)
4. Estimate **effort/duration** for each task

### Phase 2: Structure the Objective

**Objective fields:**
- `title`: Clear, concise (max 200 chars) - what will be achieved
- `description`: Context, success criteria, background (max 10,000 chars)

**Task fields (for each task):**
- `title`: Specific action (max 500 chars) - verb-first recommended
- `description`: Details, acceptance criteria, context
- `start_date`: When work should begin (ISO 8601)
- `end_date`: Deadline (ISO 8601)
- `risk_level`: `Low`, `Medium`, or `High`
- `assignee`: Default to founder (user) unless specified

### Phase 3: Calculate Dates

Use this logic for date assignment:

```
Today = start reference point
Default task duration = 3-5 days for simple tasks, 7-14 days for complex

1. Tasks without dependencies → Start today or next business day
2. Dependent tasks → Start day after predecessor's end_date
3. Parallel tasks → Can share same start_date
4. Add 1-2 day buffer between task groups
```

**Example timeline:**
```
Task 1: Research (no deps)    → Start: Today,     End: Today + 3 days
Task 2: Design (no deps)      → Start: Today,     End: Today + 5 days  
Task 3: Build (deps: 1,2)     → Start: Day 6,     End: Day 13
Task 4: Test (deps: 3)        → Start: Day 14,    End: Day 17
Task 5: Deploy (deps: 4)      → Start: Day 18,    End: Day 19
```

### Phase 4: Present to User for Confirmation

Before creating, show the user:

```markdown
## Objective: [Title]
[Description]

### Tasks:

| # | Task | Duration | Start | Due | Risk |
|---|------|----------|-------|-----|------|
| 1 | [Task 1 title] | X days | YYYY-MM-DD | YYYY-MM-DD | Low |
| 2 | [Task 2 title] | X days | YYYY-MM-DD | YYYY-MM-DD | Medium |
...

**Total timeline:** X days (from [start] to [end])

Shall I create this objective with these tasks?
```

### Phase 5: Create in CentaurOS

Once user confirms, use the `createObjectiveFromInput` server action:

```typescript
import { createObjectiveFromInput, calculateTaskDates } from '@/actions/objective-from-input'

// Calculate dates based on today and task durations
const today = new Date()
const taskDates = calculateTaskDates(today, [
  { index: 0, durationDays: 3 },                    // Task 1: 3 days, no deps
  { index: 1, durationDays: 5 },                    // Task 2: 5 days, no deps
  { index: 2, durationDays: 7, dependsOn: [0, 1] }, // Task 3: 7 days, after 1 & 2
  { index: 3, durationDays: 4, dependsOn: [2] },    // Task 4: 4 days, after 3
])

// Create the objective with tasks
const result = await createObjectiveFromInput({
  title: "Launch New Feature",
  description: "Implement and deploy the automated invoice system",
  tasks: [
    {
      title: "Research requirements",
      description: "Document technical requirements and constraints",
      start_date: taskDates[0].startDate,
      end_date: taskDates[0].endDate,
      risk_level: "Low"
    },
    {
      title: "Design architecture",
      description: "Create system design and data model",
      start_date: taskDates[1].startDate,
      end_date: taskDates[1].endDate,
      risk_level: "Medium"
    },
    // ... more tasks
  ]
})

if (result.error) {
  console.error(result.error)
} else {
  console.log(`Created objective ${result.objectiveId} with ${result.taskCount} tasks`)
}
```

**Server action location:** `src/actions/objective-from-input.ts`

**Key functions:**
- `createObjectiveFromInput(input)` - Creates objective + tasks in one transaction
- `calculateTaskDates(startDate, taskDurations)` - Helper for date calculation with dependencies

## Risk Level Guidelines

| Risk Level | Criteria | Approval Flow |
|------------|----------|---------------|
| **Low** | Routine, reversible, internal-only | Auto-completes |
| **Medium** | Moderate impact, needs review | Peer review required |
| **High** | Client-facing, irreversible, high stakes | Executive approval required |
