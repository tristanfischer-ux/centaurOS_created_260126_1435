# Comprehensive Code Review

Systematic methodology for deep code analysis across multiple quality dimensions.

## Review Workflow

### Step 1: Scope the Review

Determine what's being reviewed:

| Scope | Approach |
|-------|----------|
| **Single file** | Full analysis of all dimensions |
| **Feature/PR** | Focus on changes + adjacent impact |
| **Module/directory** | Architecture focus + sampling |
| **Full codebase** | High-level patterns + spot checks |

### Step 2: Run Analysis

Execute relevant checks based on scope:

```bash
# Complexity analysis
npx eslint src/path/to/file.tsx --rule 'complexity: [error, 10]'

# Find large files (potential complexity)
find src/ -name "*.tsx" -exec wc -l {} + | sort -rn | head -20

# Check for TODO/FIXME debt
rg "TODO|FIXME|HACK|XXX" src/ --count-matches

# Find duplicate code patterns
rg -c "const \w+ = async \(.*\) =>" src/ | sort -t: -k2 -rn | head -10

# Check test coverage
npm run test -- --coverage --collectCoverageFrom='src/path/**/*.{ts,tsx}'
```

### Step 3: Generate Review Report

Use this template for findings:

```markdown
# Code Review: [Scope]

**Reviewed:** [Date]
**Overall Grade:** [A-F]
**Risk Level:** [Low/Medium/High/Critical]

## Review Dimensions

### 1. Architecture Analysis

**What to check:**
- Single Responsibility: Does each file/function do one thing?
- Dependency direction: Do dependencies flow correctly?
- Layer separation: Are concerns properly separated?
- Abstraction levels: Is complexity hidden appropriately?

**Patterns to find:**

```bash
# Files with too many imports (coupling)
rg "^import" src/path/ | cut -d: -f1 | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -10

# Circular dependencies
npx madge --circular src/

# God components (too many responsibilities)
rg -l "useState.*useState.*useState.*useState" src/components/
```

**Red flags:**
- 🔴 Circular dependencies between modules
- 🔴 Business logic in UI components
- 🟡 Components over 300 lines
- 🟡 Files importing from 10+ different modules

### 2. Security Analysis

**What to check:**
- Input validation and sanitization
- Authentication/authorization patterns
- Sensitive data handling
- SQL/NoSQL injection vectors
- XSS vulnerabilities

**Patterns to find:**

```bash
# Potential SQL injection (string interpolation in queries)
rg "\$\{.*\}" src/ -g "*.ts" | rg -i "select|insert|update|delete|from|where"

# Hardcoded secrets
rg "(password|secret|api.?key|token)\s*[:=]" src/ -i

# Unsafe innerHTML
rg "dangerouslySetInnerHTML|innerHTML" src/

# Missing input validation
rg "req\.(body|params|query)\." src/actions/ | head -20

# Exposed error details
rg "catch.*error.*message" src/ | rg -v "console"
```

**Red flags:**
- 🔴 Hardcoded credentials or API keys
- 🔴 SQL queries with string interpolation
- 🔴 Missing RLS policies on new tables
- 🟡 Error messages exposing internals
- 🟡 Missing input sanitization

### 3. Performance Analysis

**What to check:**
- N+1 query patterns
- Unnecessary re-renders
- Missing memoization
- Large bundle contributions
- Expensive operations in render

**Patterns to find:**

```bash
# Potential N+1 queries (loops with await)
rg "for.*await|\.forEach.*await|\.map.*await" src/

# Missing useMemo/useCallback in complex components
rg -l "useState" src/components/ | xargs rg -L "useMemo|useCallback"

# Large imports (bundle impact)
rg "import \* as|import {[^}]{100,}" src/

# Expensive operations in JSX
rg "\.filter\(|\.map\(|\.reduce\(" src/components/ | rg "return.*<"
```

**Red flags:**
- 🔴 Await inside loops without batching
- 🔴 Large data transformations on every render
- 🟡 Missing React.memo on list items
- 🟡 Importing entire libraries for single functions

### 4. Maintainability Analysis

**What to check:**
- Code clarity and readability
- Naming conventions
- Documentation quality
- Consistent patterns
- Technical debt markers

**Patterns to find:**

```bash
# Long functions (hard to understand)
rg -A 50 "^(export )?(async )?(function|const) \w+" src/ | rg -c "^--$" | sort -t: -k2 -rn

# Magic numbers/strings
rg "[^a-zA-Z]([0-9]{3,}|[0-9]+\.[0-9]+)[^a-zA-Z0-9]" src/ | rg -v "test|spec"

# Any types (type safety erosion)
rg ": any|as any" src/ --count-matches

# Commented out code (dead code)
rg "^\s*//.*\(|^\s*//.*{|^\s*/\*" src/ | head -20

# Missing error handling
rg "\.catch\(\(\) => \{\}\)" src/
```

**Red flags:**
- 🔴 Functions over 50 lines
- 🔴 Deeply nested conditionals (>3 levels)
- 🟡 Magic numbers without constants
- 🟡 Excessive use of `any` type
- 🟡 Missing JSDoc on exported functions

### 5. Test Coverage Analysis

**What to check:**
- Coverage of critical paths
- Edge case handling
- Integration vs unit balance
- Test quality (not just quantity)

**Patterns to find:**

```bash
# Files without tests
for f in src/**/*.ts; do
  test_file="${f%.ts}.test.ts"
  [ ! -f "$test_file" ] && echo "Missing: $f"
done

# Test file coverage
npm run test -- --coverage --coverageReporters=text-summary

# Weak assertions
rg "expect\(.*\)\.toBeTruthy\(\)|expect\(.*\)\.toBeDefined\(\)" src/
```

**Red flags:**
- 🔴 Zero tests for critical business logic
- 🔴 Tests that only check "truthy"
- 🟡 Low branch coverage (<70%)
- 🟡 No integration tests for API endpoints

### 6. Auditability Analysis

This dimension evaluates whether the code can be understood by a third-party auditor.

**What to check:**
- **JSDoc Coverage**: Are exported functions documented?
- **Security Annotations**: Is auth/permission logic annotated?
- **Business Logic Clarity**: Are non-obvious decisions explained?
- **Intent vs Implementation**: Can an auditor understand WHY, not just WHAT?

**Patterns to find:**

```bash
# Check JSDoc coverage on exports
rg "^export (async )?function" --type ts -l | wc -l
rg "^\s*\*.*@param" --type ts -l | wc -l

# Check security annotations
rg "// (SECURITY|AUTH|RLS):" --type ts -c

# Find undocumented exports
rg -B 3 "^export (async )?function" src/ | rg -v "/\*\*|^\s*\*" | rg "^export"

# Check for inline explanations
rg "// (NOTE|REASON|WHY|BECAUSE):" src/ -c
```

**Red flags:**
- 🔴 No documentation on security-critical functions
- 🔴 Complex business logic without explanation
- 🟡 Missing JSDoc on exported functions
- 🟡 Auth/permission checks without annotations
- 🟡 Magic values without explaining why

**Grading:**

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **A** | Comprehensive JSDoc, security annotations, business logic explained |
| **B** | Most exports documented, security code annotated |
| **C** | Some documentation, inconsistent annotation |
| **D** | Minimal documentation, missing security annotations |
| **F** | No documentation, intent unclear |

## Grading Rubric

### Overall Grade

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **A** | No critical issues, minor suggestions only |
| **B** | No critical issues, some recommendations |
| **C** | 1-2 critical issues, several recommendations |

|-------|-------------|----------|-------------|-----------------|--------------|
| **A** | Clean separation, proper abstractions | No vulnerabilities, proper validation | Optimized queries, efficient renders | Clear, documented, consistent | Full JSDoc, security annotated, intent clear |
| **B** | Minor coupling issues | Low-risk findings | Minor optimization opportunities | Some unclear areas | Most exports documented, security noted |
| **C** | Noticeable coupling | Medium-risk findings | Performance issues likely | Inconsistent patterns | Partial docs, inconsistent annotations |
| **D** | Significant architecture issues | High-risk vulnerabilities | Known performance problems | Hard to understand | Minimal docs, missing security notes |
| **F** | No clear architecture | Critical security flaws | Severe performance issues | Unmaintainable | No docs, intent unclear |

## Feedback Format

Use these markers for clarity:

| Marker | Meaning | Action Required |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| 🔴 **Critical** | Blocks deployment/merge | Must fix |
| 🟡 **Recommendation** | Significant improvement | Should fix |
| 🟢 **Suggestion** | Nice to have | Consider |
| ✅ **Strength** | Worth noting | Keep doing |
| 💡 **Learning** | Educational note | Awareness |

### Example Feedback

```markdown
🔴 **Critical: SQL Injection Risk** (src/actions/users.ts:45)

The user ID is interpolated directly into the query string without sanitization.

```typescript
// Current (vulnerable)
const result = await db.query(`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = '${userId}'`)

// Fixed
const result = await db.from('users').select().eq('id', userId)
```

---

🟡 **Recommendation: Extract Business Logic** (src/components/OrderForm.tsx)

The component contains 80 lines of order validation logic mixed with UI code.
Extract to `lib/orders/validation.ts` for testability and reuse.

---

✅ **Strength: Excellent Error Boundaries**

The error handling pattern in `src/app/error.tsx` provides great UX with
helpful recovery options. Consider documenting this as the standard pattern.
```
