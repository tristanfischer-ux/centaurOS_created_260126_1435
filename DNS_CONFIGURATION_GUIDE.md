## Vercel DNS Records for centaurdynamics.io

**Note:** We'll configure this one after centauros.io is working.

For now, you can either:
- **Option A:** Add the same records (if you want it to also point to the app)
- **Option B:** Leave it for later when we build a separate company site

---

## Verification

### After adding DNS records:

1. **Wait 5-10 minutes** for DNS propagation
2. **Check domain status:**
   ```bash
   vercel domains ls
   ```

3. **Visit your site:**
   - https://centauros.io
   - https://www.centauros.io

4. **Verify SSL certificate** (auto-generated by Vercel)

---

## Troubleshooting

### If domain doesn't work after 30 minutes:

1. **Verify DNS records are correct:**
   ```bash
   dig centauros.io
   dig www.centauros.io
   ```

2. **Check Vercel dashboard:**
   - Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Click your project
   - Check "Domains" tab for status

3. **Common issues:**
   - Wrong IP address (must be 76.76.21.21)
   - Typo in CNAME value
   - Old DNS cached (wait longer or clear DNS cache)
